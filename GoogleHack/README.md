# Google BGN 2019 Hackathon

Creation of an interactive online Business Insight Dashboard using Streamlit. This dashboard is divided in three main components:

1) **Financial Analysis** : in this section Stock Market data is fetched in real-time from a chosen public company. Using the fetched data, a Competitor Analysis and Machine Learning prediction are automatically generated in order to provide insights.

2) **Corporate Social Responsibility**: analysis of how the selected company takes care of topics such as protecting the environment and what's their global utility.

3) **Sentiment Analysis**: research about what people say about the chosen company and what reach overall can the company have on the public.
